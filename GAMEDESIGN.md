## Project Overview

Idle Artifice is a browser-based idle game where the player is in charge of an academy that makes magical items. The academy is situated on the edge of a vast wilderness where the academy sends exploration teams to recover new ingredients to create new magical items. Each magical item gives members of the exploratory teams unique skills that allow them to access new areas of the wilderness that were previously unreachable.

## Game Overview and Vision

High Concept: A management sim where you play as the head of a magical item research facility which generates items to explore an untamed wilderness.

Game Summary: The player manages their base in order to convert resources into unique items. Each item can be assigned to an explorer which gives that character unique abilities. Characters use those abilities to unlock new areas of the frontier, combat monsters, and solve puzzles to reach new ingredients. The player then generates new items to progress further. Each obstacle can be overcome by multiple creative solutions and slowly reveals a larger mystery of the frontier.

Player Journey Snapshot: Early game - the player starts to rebuild and expand their facility, opening up new options for crafting. First getting basic equipment set up, then allowing characters to secure the neighboring borders, followed by unlocking other resource generation which builds into the crafting mechanic. Late game - the player can optimize their crafting setup to generate wild new abilities to progress deeper into the frontier, as well as cosmetically upgrading their facility.
Unique Selling Points (USP): Creative "limitless" crafting with a sense of humor. Progression towards a larger mystery. Puzzle solving.
Target Audience: People who enjoy idle games with mid-to-high levels of input
Genre & Inspirations: Idle games, Shop Titans, crafting simulators
Tone & Look & Feel: Bright, humorous, Stardew Valley-esque
3. Core Gameplay Design
Describes how the game is played. Focuses on the primary loop, progression, and the player’s feel of control.
⚠️ If your loop isn’t simple and clear, your game will feel aimless; and players will bounce before they understand the fun.

Core Gameplay Loop: Break it into 3 steps: What the player does → what changes → what the reward is. Repeatable actions that form the backbone of play.
Example: Explore → Fight → Get loot → Upgrade character → Repeat.
Player Progression: How does the player grow over time? This includes level-ups, new abilities, gear, story progress, world unlocking, etc.
Controls & Input: List default inputs and control schemes. Explain if the game is click-heavy, skill-based, or slower-paced. Mention accessibility (remapping, alternative inputs).
Difficulty & Challenge: What is the baseline difficulty? How does it escalate? Is it player-chosen (easy/normal/hard), dynamic, or fixed?
Feedback Systems: How does the game talk back to the player? Visual, audio, UI… everything from screen shake to a “ding” when looting matters.
4. Game Mechanics & Systems
This section breaks down the underlying rules and systems that support the gameplay loop.
⚠️ If this section is vague or hand-wavy, your devs will invent mechanics on the fly and you’ll spend months untangling them.

Core Mechanics: Actions or interactions that are always present (shooting, platforming, crafting, dialogue, etc.)
Example: “The player can combine ingredients to cook recipes, each with unique buffs.”
Side Mechanics: Optional or supplementary mechanics like fishing, mini-games, base-building, etc. They’re not core to the loop, but they provide variety.
Interaction Mechanics: How the player engages with the world. Are they dragging items, typing spells, rotating the camera? Touchscreens? Dialogue trees?
Economy & Resources: Any in-game currencies, collectibles, or trade systems. Clarify sources, sinks, and exchange rules.
Example: “Gold is earned via quests and spent at vendors or for upgrading gear.”
5. Narrative, World, & Characters
Even if your game is light on story, this section helps define tone, cohesion, and world logic.
⚠️ If you leave this empty, your story will creep into the game in a poorly integrated and confusing way.

Themes & Emotional Arc: What big ideas or moods does the game explore? Revenge? Growth? Isolation?
Story Overview: Summarize the narrative arc from start to finish. Focus on the player’s journey, not script lines.
Worldbuilding: What’s the setting? What are its rules (e.g., sci-fi tech, magic systems)? Are there factions, biomes, or cultural norms?
Main Characters: Who does the player control? Who are the allies or antagonists? Keep it brief unless story is central.
Player Agency: Are there choices that affect the story or world? How deep are they—just dialogue or full branching paths?
6. Level & Encounter Design
Outlines the structure and goals of the spaces the player moves through.
⚠️ If you can’t explain what a typical level feels like or what the player is trying to accomplish, your content will lack purpose.

Objectives: What’s the win condition at a typical level? Survive, escape, build something, solve puzzles?
Structure & Layout: Describe the spatial format: Linear corridors? Hubs? Open world?
Gameplay Flow: What does the player do first, second, third? How is tension built or relaxed? Include pacing if relevant.
Interactive Elements: Buttons, doors, traps, puzzles—anything that demands input.
Progression Gates: Keys, levels, bosses—what blocks access and why?
Environmental Storytelling: Does the world itself tell part of the story? Think ruined villages, propaganda posters, blood trails.
7. UI, UX, & Accessibility
Covers how players interact with the game outside of direct mechanics, especially through screens and inputs.
⚠️ If this section is blank, your player will suffer even if the mechanics are great. Here, clarity trumps cleverness.

Core UI Elements: Health bars, inventory slots, currency indicators. Should be immediately readable.
Menus & Screens: What menus are in the game (pause, settings, map, loadout)? How are they navigated?
HUD Design: What’s shown persistently during gameplay? What’s contextual?
UX Flow: How does the player move from main menu to playing? From gameplay to inventory to quest log? Reduce friction.
Onboarding: How does the game teach itself? Tutorials, tooltips, slow introduction of mechanics?
Accessibility Options: Subtitles, colorblind modes, remappable keys, difficulty settings. Think inclusivity, as not everybody is an Elden Ring or Starcraft master.
8. Production Notes (Optional)
This is where you put planning material if it doesn’t live in a separate production doc. Can be skipped if you’re still in the pre-production or planning phase.
⚠️ If you ignore this section, future-you will wonder why everything is late, broken, and missing half the features.

Team Roles: Who’s responsible for what (designer, coder, artist)?
Milestones: Rough phases (prototype, vertical slice, alpha, beta, launch)
Out-of-scope Features: Things you cut but don’t want to forget.
Marketing Hooks: Wishlist bait, pitch phrases, trailer moments
Risks & Unknowns: Tech doubts, design uncertainty, or things that need prototyping.
Live Ops & Post-Launch: Even a solo dev should plan for bugfixes, updates, or community wishlist.
