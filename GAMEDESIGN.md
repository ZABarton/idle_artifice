## Project Overview

Idle Artifice is a browser-based idle game where the player is in charge of an academy that makes magical items. The academy is situated on the edge of a vast wilderness where the academy sends exploration teams to recover new ingredients to create new magical items. Each magical item gives members of the exploratory teams unique skills that allow them to access new areas of the wilderness that were previously unreachable.

## Game Overview and Vision

High Concept: A management sim where you play as the head of a magical item research facility which generates items to explore an untamed wilderness.

Game Summary: The player manages their base in order to convert resources into unique items. Each item can be assigned to an explorer which gives that character unique abilities. Characters use those abilities to unlock new areas of the frontier, combat monsters, and solve puzzles to reach new ingredients. The player then generates new items to progress further. Each obstacle can be overcome by multiple creative solutions and slowly reveals a larger mystery of the frontier.

Player Journey Snapshot: Early game - the player starts to rebuild and expand their facility, opening up new options for crafting. First getting basic equipment set up, then allowing characters to secure the neighboring borders, followed by unlocking other resource generation which builds into the crafting mechanic. Late game - the player can optimize their crafting setup to generate wild new abilities to progress deeper into the frontier, as well as cosmetically upgrading their facility.
Unique Selling Points (USP): Creative "limitless" crafting with a sense of humor. Progression towards a larger mystery. Puzzle solving.
Target Audience: People who enjoy idle games with mid-to-high levels of input
Genre & Inspirations: Idle games, Shop Titans, crafting simulators
Tone & Look & Feel: Bright, humorous, Stardew Valley-esque

## Core Gameplay Design

Core Gameplay Loop: 
- Secure an Area on the World Map
- Use the Area to start generating resources for improving Explorers
- Use the Explorers to overcome obstacles to enter new Areas
- New Areas introduce different resources and crafting mechanics
- Repeat

Player Progression:
- Each Area has its own incremental resource generator that can be improved or optimized
- The player can set up these Areas to generate resources used for crafting
- Crafted Magical Items can be assigned to Explorers to give them abilities to overcome obstacles
- The obstacles become more complex over time and involve more creative effort from the player to overcomee
- Resources can be also used for further optimization and/or cosmetic upgrades

Controls & Input: Mouse driven with keyboard shortcuts. This is mostly management and slower paced.

Difficulty & Challenge: Challenges get harder as the game progresses and overcoming them requires more complex resource generation and management.

Feedback Systems: UI Systems make it very clear what can be unlocked next and how to do it
